# arithmetic operations
a = 4
b = 2
c = 3
x = 234
y = 101
z = 89
j = 201.4
total = x + y # addition
total = x - y # subtraction
total = x * y # multiplication
total = x / y # division
total = x // y # floor division
total = a ** c # exponents

# exponents comes first, multiplication and division follows followed by addition and subtraction, brackets is the absolute priority

total = (a + b) ** c
